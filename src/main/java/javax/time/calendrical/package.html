functions for date and time field access, units, adjusters, and weeks.
Support is included for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Date time units</li>
    <li>Date time fields</li>
    <li>Additional date time value types</li>
    <li>Common date time adjustment functions</li>
    <li>Week rules and functions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dates and times are expressed in terms of fields and units.
A unit is used to measure an amount of time, such as years, days or minutes.
{@link javax.time.calendrical.PeriodUnit} defines a measurable
date or time unit.  The set of well known units is defined in
{@link javax.time.calendrical.LocalPeriodUnit}, for example, 
{@link javax.time.calendrical.LocalPeriodUnit#DAYS}.
</p>
<p>
A field is used to express part of a complete date or time, such as year,
month-of-year or second-of-minute.
{@link javax.time.calendrical.DateTimeField} provides the abstraction for a field.
The well known fields are defined in {@link javax.time.calendrical.LocalDateTimeField},
for example, {@link javax.time.calendrical.LocalDateTimeField#HOUR_OF_DAY}.
Additional fields are defined by {@link javax.time.calendrical.JulianDayField}
and {@link javax.time.calendrical.QuarterYearField}.
</p>
<p>
This package provides tools that allow the units and fields of date and time to be accessed
in a general way most suited for frameworks.
{@link javax.time.calendrical.DateTime} provides the abstraction for
date time types that support fields.  Its methods support getting the value
of a field, creating a new date time with the value of a field modified,
or extracting another date time type.
The fields and units are occasionally useful in application code.
For example, the overall range of valid values for a field can be obtained from the field.
</p>
<p>
The set of known fields and units can be extended by implementing the
{@link javax.time.calendrical.DateTimeField} interface.
For example, this is most useful to define additional sub-divisions of date/time,
such as a fortnights (two week periods) or financial year accounting.
</p>
<p>
The full date and time types are sometimes include more information
than is needed for a particular use case; additional date time value
types include  {@link javax.time.calendrical.Year},
{@link javax.time.calendrical.YearMonth}, {@link javax.time.calendrical.MonthDay},
{@link javax.time.calendrical.QuarterOfYear}.
</p>
<p>
Functions to compute new date times are supported by the
{@link javax.time.calendrical.DateTimeAdjuster} interface.
A set of common functions are provided in {@link javax.time.calendrical.DateTimeAdjusters},
for example, to find the next date time having a requested
{@link javax.time.calendrical.DateTimeAdjusters#nextOrCurrent(DayOfWeek)}.
</p>
<p>
{@link javax.time.calendrical.WeekContext} provides functions to
identify variable aspects of weeks, including aligning weeks
to the year or the month and being able to identify working days
and weekend days.
