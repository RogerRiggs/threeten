/**
 * Provider of time-zone rules to the system.
 * <p>
 * This class manages time-zone rules.
 * The static methods provide the public API that can be used to manage the providers.
 * The abstract methods provide the SPI that allows rules to be provided.
 * <p>
 * Rules are looked up be group, version and region. The group and region are
 * expressed in the {@link ZoneId}, whereas the version is specific to the providers.
 * <p>
 * Since time-zone rules are political, the data can change at any time.
 * The set of current rules is managed by groups which publish new versions of
 * the data set over time to handle the political changes.
 * The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year followed
 * by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.
 * Versions are assumed to be sortable in lexicographical order.
 * Version IDs must match the regex {@code [A-Za-z0-9._-]+}.
 * <p>
 * Caching is the responsibility of the SPI implementation.
 * Any rules that are returned once for a given lookup must continue to be returned
 * in the future.
 * <p>
 * Many systems would like to receive new time-zone rules dynamically.
 * This must be implemented separately from this interface, typically using a listener.
 * Whenever the listener detects new rules it should call
 * {@link #registerProvider(ZoneRulesProvider)} using a standard
 * immutable provider implementation.
 *
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface is a service provider that can be called by multiple threads.
 * Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe.
