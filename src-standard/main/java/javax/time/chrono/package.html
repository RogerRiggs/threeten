Support for calendar systems other than the default ISO.
</p>
<p>
The main API is based around the calendar system defined in ISO-8601.
This package provides support for alternate systems.
</p>
The supported calendar systems includes:
<ul>
    <li>{@link javax.time.chrono.CopticChronology Coptic Calendar}</li>
    <li>{@link javax.time.chrono.HijrahChronology Hijrah Calendar}</li>
    <li>{@link javax.time.chrono.ISOChronology ISO Calendar}</li>
    <li>{@link javax.time.chrono.JapaneseChronology Japanese Calendar}</li>
    <li>{@link javax.time.chrono.MinguoChronology Minguo Calendar}</li>
    <li>{@link javax.time.chrono.ThaiBuddhistChronology ThaiBuddhist Calendar}</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is intended that applications use the main API whenever possible, including code to read and write
from a persistent data store, such as a database, and to send dates and times across a network.
This package is then used at the user interface level to deal with localized input/output.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
This example creates and uses a date in a non-ISO calendar system.
</p>
<pre>
    // print the date in each available calendar system
    Set&lt;String&gt; names = Chrono.getAvailableNames();
    for (String name : names) {
        Chrono chrono = Chrono.ofName(name);
        ChronoDate date = chrono.now();
        System.out.printf("%s: %s%n", chrono.getName(), date.toString());
    }

    // print the Coptic date and calendar
    ChronoDate date = Chrono.ofName("Coptic").now();
    int dom = date.getDayOfMonth();
    int month = date.getMonthOfYear();
    int year = date.getProlepticYear();
    System.out.printf("Today is %s %d-%d-%d%n",
        date.getChronology().getName(), dom, month, year);

    // print today's date and the last day of the year
    ChronoDate today = Chrono.ofName("Coptic").now();
    ChronoDate first = today.withDayOfYear(1);
    ChronoDate last = first.plusYears(1).minusDays(1);
    System.out.printf("Today is %s: start: %s; end: %s%n",
        last.getChronology().getName(), first, last);

</pre>
</body>
