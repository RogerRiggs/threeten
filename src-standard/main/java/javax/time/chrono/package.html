Support for calendar systems other than the default ISO.
</p>
<p>
The main API in the {@code javax.time} package is based around the calendar system
defined in ISO-8601.
This package provides support for alternate systems.
</p>
<p>
It is intended that applications use the main API whenever possible, including code to read and write
from a persistent data store, such as a database, and to send dates and times across a network.
This package is then used at the user interface level to deal with localized input/output.
</p>
<p>
    The set of calendars can be extended as described in the {@link Chrono} class.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
        // Enumerate the list of available calendars and print today for each
        Set&lt;String&gt; cnames = ChronoDate.getCalendarNames();
        for (String name : cnames) {
            Chrono ch = ChronoDate.getByName(name);
            ChronoDate chdate = ch.now();
            System.out.printf("%s: %s%n", ch.getName(), chdate.toString());
        }

        // Print the Coptic date and calendar
        ChronoDate date = ChronoDate.getByName("Coptic").now();
        int day = date.getDayOfMonth();
        DayOfWeek dow = date.getDayOfWeek();
        int year = date.getProlepticYear();
        System.out.printf("Today is %s %d-%s-%d%n", date.getChronology().getName(),
                day, dow.getValue(), year);

        // Print today's date and the last day of the year
        ChronoDate now1 = ChronoDate.getByName("Coptic").now();
        ChronoDate first = now1.withDayOfMonth(1).withMonthOfYear(1);
        ChronoDate last = first.plusYears(1).minusDays(1);
        System.out.printf("Today is %s: start: %s; end: %s%n", last.getChronology().getName(),
                first, last);
</pre>
</body>
